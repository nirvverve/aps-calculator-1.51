APS Residential Pool Chemistry Calculator v1.1.0
Specifically for residential pools only

**OVERVIEW**
The APS Pool Chemistry Calculator is a specialized tool designed to help pool service professionals and homeowners maintain optimal water chemistry in residential swimming pools. This calculator provides precise chemical dosing recommendations based on test results, pool size, and geographic location.

**PRIORITIZED CHEMICAL DOSING FOR WATER BALANCE**
When multiple water balance parameters are out of balance, the calculator prioritizes corrections in a specific order to ensure safe and effective treatment:

pH and Total Alkalinity: These are addressed first as they affect sanitizer efficiency and water comfort
Calcium Hardness: Adjusted to prevent scaling or corrosion
Cyanuric Acid (Stabilizer): Adjusted to protect chlorine from UV degradation

If multiple parameters need correction, the calculator will recommend addressing the most critical ones immediately and schedule others for subsequent visits, preventing chemical conflicts and over-correction.

**STATE DEFINED TARGETS**
Parameter	    	   
pH  7.6 (Fla) 7.5 (Tx and Az)
Total Alkalinity 80 ppm (Fla) 120 ppm (Tx and Az)
Calcium Hardness 300 ppm (Fla) 400 ppm (Tx and Az)
Cyanuric Acid	  50 ppm (Fla) 80 ppm (Tx and Az)

These targets were carefully selected to provide the best balance between water comfort, equipment protection, and sanitizer efficiency in each region's specific climate conditions.

**CUSTOMIZED SANITIZER DOSING**
Sanitizer Dosing Logic:
The calculator employs advanced sanitizer dosing logic based on:
    The 5% Rule: Minimum Free Chlorine (FC) should be 5% of Cyanuric Acid (CYA) level
    UV Loss Factor: Accounts for chlorine degradation due to sunlight exposure, varying by season

Regional Product Differences:
    Florida: Recommends 12.5% liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)
    Arizona/Texas: Recommends 73% calcium hypochlorite (granular)
    This approach ensures adequate sanitization while accounting for stabilizer levels and regional preferences.

LSI:
    The calculator provides LSI calculations to determine if water is balanced, corrosive, or scale-forming. This helps protect pool surfaces and equipment from damage while maintaining water clarity.
