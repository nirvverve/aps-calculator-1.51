{"id":"bd-1lh","title":"Add backend guards for state/lang and numeric parsing","description":"Add backend guards for invalid/missing `state` and `lang`, and treat required numeric fields as required (avoid `parseFloat(...) || 0` masking invalid input).","acceptance_criteria":"1. Unknown `state` or `lang` returns a controlled, localized error (no crash).\n2. Missing required numeric fields return `errorRequired` and do not default to 0.\n3. Optional fields only default when explicitly intended.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-31T02:32:58.446084108Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-31T02:50:04.754877807Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

Salt-pool advice HTML has no stray closing tags (no visible \"/em\" in UI).\n2. Spanish `saltChlorineBelowTarget` is translated correctly (not Italian).\n3. Salt-pool advice renders correctly for low chlorine cases.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-31T02:33:05.912505332Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-31T02:49:57.364622641Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

If version is changed, update all displayed locations consistently (index footer + header + any other pages).","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2026-01-31T02:50:33.327166017Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-31T02:50:37.553431453Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

This can expose user inputs and internal files (.beads, .ntm, node_modules) over HTTP.","acceptance_criteria":"1. Static server only serves intended public assets (e.g., a dedicated public root).\n2. GET `/user_activity.log` returns 404 (log stored outside public root or disabled).\n3.

Optional fields (TDS/temperature if intended) do not block submission when blank.\n3. Error messages match the actual enforced ranges.","notes":"Decision needed: confirm intended minima for capacity, alkalinity, and temperature (currently inconsistent across UI/README/backend).","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-31T02:32:54.787727045Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-31T02:50:12.068259127Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
